        <p>Nitro League is a decentralized game metaverse where the community can earn tokens by racing futuristic cars competitively or exploring the many in-game activities casually.</p>
        <p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have gained tremendous popularity among the crypto community since the beginning of 2021, reaching $13 billion in Sales by October 2021. It is being recommended as the number one choice for investment by most financial experts around the globe. The gaming community has been spending on digital assets for decades, and NFTs have become the most logical way for gamers to own their assets, even outside the game. Despite the fact, only about 20% of the NFT assets are game-related, because of how new the NFT marketplace is. Even the NFT games that have been released were produced in unrealistically tight timelines without paying much attention to game quality or logic.</p>
        <p>The team at Nitro League has been creating games for decades and aims to launch the first-ever high-quality, sustainable, and addictive NFT racing game to hit the market. Our vision is to leverage the true power of blockchain technology by making every aspect of the game decentralized, so the community can hold all the power in the game.</p>
        <h5>Problems Worth Solving:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Play To Win: In conventional games, rich players can simply buy items that make them progress in the game faster than poor players. This creates a very unpleasant gaming experience for veterans that are highly skilled but are designed to lose against richer players. The best sports tournaments ensure that the most skilled players around the world compete with each other, not the richest.</li>
          <li>
            Improper Balancing Of Characters: Most games release a large number of characters so the players can choose from a large pool of heroes; however, this usually leads to poor balancing between characters. Without proper balancing, the weaker characters will be valued lower and eventually leave no liquidity‌.
          </li>
          <li>
            Barrier To Entry For New Players: Most NFT games do not provide a player hierarchy or rank system that leaves the strong dominating the tournaments. New players have no chance to earn until they have spent enough time and money within the game to master the mechanics

        <div class="wp-main gp-lore">
          <h3 id="gp-lore">2.1. Lore</h3>

          <h4>The world</h4>
          <p>The year is 3050. The world has evolved and progressed into a very optimistic future. There were no apocalyptic events in the past. Technology is the best we can envision, which includes buildings, power & energy supply, and preservation of nature (greenery). Public transport vehicles are all self-driving and mostly flying. Land space on earth is usually used for nature (plants, animals, water bodies, etc.)</p>

          <h4>The racing fever</h4>
          <p>Communities are productive and wealthy with all necessities of life taken care of (food, water, power, education, etc.). People work only to support their hobbies. Needless to say, the most hard-working people are the ones with luxurious hobbies (i.e. collecting cars), and the most well-paid jobs are to fuel these hobbies (i.e. car racing). There are no roads on land like in 2020. Car racing is a sport in 3050 (similar to horse racing in 2020).</p>

          <h4>The city of racing</h4>
          <p>The city of Ethermoor hosts the biggest racing events in the universe. The ancient city was created by racing enthusiasts and is built to promote the racing craze for the entire universe. Disputes are no longer settled by conflict and war, but rather in the good old fashion way ... racing. Status, power, honor, and wealth are now earned through racing in the grand Nitro arena. In the middle of the city lies the main attraction, the grand racing arena. The best place in the universe to witness innovative cars and thrilling races. Drivers from around the world dream of getting a chance to race at the grand arena.</p>

          <h4>society structure</h4>
          <p>The known universe in 3050 is ruled by “The Supreme Six”. These 6 nations have managed to live in harmony for centuries with an understanding of each other’s differences. Any disputes that do arise are settled the old fashion way - a well-executed sports tournament. The most popular of these sports is car racing, and the best events are hosted at the city of Ethermoor at the Nitro Arena.</p>
          <p>The residents of the city are divided into clans that are part of a nation. Nations are known for their unique racing skills and technology. There can be any number of clans in each nation registered by real-world Nitro Elders. To race in the Nitro League, players must join a clan. Players are rewarded a badge (rank system) by the clan-based on their Reputation Points (RP). Players can switch nations or clans at any time; however, switching nations or clans have consequences (like losing nation/clan-specific attribute bonuses and locations).</p>
          <p>When players win matches, they earn RP from the matches and lose it when they don't perform. If the player reaches a certain tier/rank and stops playing the game, there would be a decay in RP which would be demoting the player’s account to help other active players reach higher tiers.</p>

        <div class="wp-main gp-cars">
          <h3 id="gp-cars">2.2. Cars</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/whitepaper-images/Collect-and-Upgrade.png" alt="">
          <p>Nitro League offers some of the most exotic futuristic NFT cars the world has ever seen. All cars in our game universe are built for racing and can be traded in real-world NFT marketplaces. The designs are inspired by different eras, starting from the year 2020 up to the year 3050.</p>
          <p>The value of any car can be gauged by its rarity - Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Common cars are cheaper to buy and don't perform as well in races; whereas, rare cars are produced in lesser numbers, are more expensive, and perform better in races.</p>
          <div class="gp-main gp-classes">
            <h3 id="gp-classes">2.2.1. Classes</h3>
            <p>6 main car classes are derived from the unique talent and technologies offered by “the Supreme Six” nations. Each class comes with its unique advantage on the race track giving attribute bonuses for Reputation, Speed, Acceleration, Handling, or Durability</p>
  
            <h4>ALPHA CLASS</h4>
            <p>Produced during the year 2000 to 2020, this class includes 4-wheel vehicles that are street, sports, rally, and drag cars. These are the original designs, the leaders of the pack, that inspired all the models to follow for years to come. The cars in this class have been winning for over a thousand years, breeding confidence, and naturally gaining people's trust. The designs have been extremely charismatic, charming, and intimidating on the race tracks since the beginning. This class is suited for the strong-willed who believe that nothing can stand in their way.</p>

            <p>Produced during the year 2021 to 2050, this class includes 4-wheel vehicles that are street, sports, rally, and drag cars. Although very similar to Alpha class vehicles, Beta class vehicles were designed to be safer, stronger, and long-lasting with exceptionally better handling. They are friendlier looking on the race track, and not as intimidating; hence, overshadowed by the reputation of Alpha class. This class is suited for reserved players who believe that defense is their best offense.</p>

            <h4>GAMMA CLASS</h4>
            <p>Produced during the year 2500 to 3050, this class includes 2 to 3 wheel vehicles that are rocket, bike, and bullet-style. These vehicles are made for adventurous journeys and constant exploration. They possess the capability to create their own path on the race tracks due to their slim size and skillful aero-dynamics. The vehicles in this class are fully aware of their surroundings and can make quick moves to stun their opponents. These vehicles are vulnerable to being pushed around by other classes due to their lightweight design. This class is suited for independent players who believe in quick take-offs and always rush to the finish line while keeping their distance from other racers.</p>

            <h4>OMEGA CLASS</h4>
            <p>Produced since the year 3000, this class includes hover vehicles that are street, sports, and muscle cars. This class hasn’t been around for a long time, but it has the fastest vehicles the world has ever seen. The hover cars are the most technologically advanced piece of machinery ever invented and can withstand any criticism from old-timers about having no wheels. Having so much speed does give them a slight disadvantage in terms of their poor handling on the race tracks. With artificial intelligence controlling most functions, the vehicles in this class are the most calculated and evolved on the race track. This class is suited for the self-assured nerds who are driven by performance and enjoy the action more than the rewards.</p>

            <h4>DELTA CLASS</h4>
            <p>Produced since the year 2020, this class includes F1-style vehicles that are 4-wheelers, 3-wheelers, 2-wheelers, and hover cars. These vehicles have been around for as long as the Alpha class and produced up to recent times (year 3050); however, their looks have not been changed very much, making them very deceptive on the race track. They are very agile when racing and can overtake opponents in the blink of an eye. To prove their mad skills; however, they are self-sabotaging by nature. Even the slightest nudge from any other class can make them go flying off the race track. This class is suited for the old-timers who believe that F1 cars are the best thing that ever happened to racing.</p>

            <p>Produced in the year 3000, this class includes 4-wheel vehicles that are street, sports, rally, muscle, and drag cars. Although fairly new, the reputation of vehicles in this class is a rockstar and is thought to surpass that of Alpha class in the future. Similar to the Omega class, Sigma is also the most technologically advanced class in the world. The vehicles are known for their artificial intelligence providing very calculated and evolved skills on the race tracks. Sigma has come up with some of the most exotic futuristic car designs the world has ever seen, along with the most well-balanced racing attributes. This class is suited for the cunning racers who are confident in their skills and don’t like playing by the rules.</p>

          <h3 id="gp-doltsus">2.5. Decentralized Organization & Long-Term Sustainability</h3>
          <p>The Nitro team's vision is to make the ownership of Nitro metaverse truly decentralized with respect to technology, authority, and economy. Nitro holders will be able to participate in key economic decisions by staking their tokens in the ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Nitro League is a platform providing NFT assets that the players can own in the real world. Unlike conventional gaming, where the game assets do not hold any real-world value, Nitro assets can be traded freely on any marketplace outside of the game. Aside from NFT assets, players are awarded credits and Nitro tokens for performing well in friendly racing competitions using their NFT cars. Players spend a great deal of time and money acquiring their favorite assets, and the beauty of NFT assets is that no matter what happens to the game or the developer, the player remains the rightful owner of the NFT assets and tokens which can never be monopolized by the game developer.</p>

          <p>Nitro League is a skill-based game with unlimited possibilities for expansion to provide endless entertainment to the gaming community. Nitro League presents an open-world metaverse with beautiful landscapes and structures as far as the eye can see. As the game community grows, players will be able to freely roam around in different cities and own garages, tracks, factories, and land. Our vision is to leverage the true power of blockchain technology to make every aspect of the game decentralized so the community can hold all the power in the game. Players will be able to create and host racing events and other activities and broadcast them online for a real-world sporting experience. Nitro League will also invite sponsors and advertisers to help support the developers in the continued delivery of high-quality, fresh, and exciting content to expand the Nitro metaverse.</p>
