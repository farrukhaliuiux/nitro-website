            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              The year is 3050. The world has evolved and progressed into a very
              optimistic future. There were no apocalyptic events in the past.
              Technology is the best we can envision, which includes buildings,
              power & energy supply, and preservation of nature (greenery).
              Public transport vehicles are all self-driving and mostly flying.
              Land space on earth is usually used for nature (plants, animals,
              water bodies, etc.)
            </p>

            <h2>1.1 The Racing Fever</h2>

            <p>
              Communities are productive and wealthy with all basic necessities
              of life taken care of (food, water, power, education, etc.).
              People work only to support their hobbies. Needless to say the
              most hard-working people are the ones with luxurious hobbies (i.e.
              collecting cars), and the most well paid jobs are to fuel these
              hobbies (i.e. car racing). There are no roads on land like in
              2020. Car racing is a sport in 3050 (similar to horse racing in
              2020).
            </p>

            <h2>1.2 The City of Racing</h2>

            <p>
              The city of Ethermoor hosts the biggest racing events in the
              universe. The ancient city was created by racing enthusiasts, and
              is built to promote the racing craze for the entire universe.
              Disputes are no longer settled by conflict and war, but rather in
              the good old fashion way ... racing. Status, power, honor and
              wealth is now earned through racing in the grand Nitro arena. In
              the middle of the city lies the main attraction, the grand racing
              arena. The best place in the universe to witness innovative cars
              and thrilling races. Drivers from around the world dream of
              getting a chance to race at the grand arena.

            <h2>1.4 Society structure at Ethermoor</h2>

            <p>
              The known universe in 3050 is ruled by “The Supreme Six” (Alpha,
              Beta, Gamme, Omega, Delta, Sigma). These 6 nations have managed to
              live in harmony for centuries with an understanding for each
              other’s differences. Any disputes that do arise are settled the
              old fashion way - a well executed sports tournament. The most
              popular of these sports is car racing, and the best events are
              hosted at the city of Ethermoor at the Nitro Arena.
            </p>

            <p>
              The residents of the city are divided into clans that are part of
              a nation. Nations are known for their unique racing skills and
              technology. There can be any number of clans in each nation
              registered by real-world Nitro Elders. To race in the Nitro
              League, players must join a clan. Players are rewarded a badge
              (rank system) by the clan based on their Reputation Points (RP).
              Players can switch nations or clans any time; however, switching
              nations or clans have consequences (like losing nation/clan
              specific attribute bonuses and locations).
            </p>

            <p>
              When players win matches, they earn RP from the matches, and lose
              it when they don't perform. If the player reaches a certain
              tier/rank and stops playing the game, there would be a decay in RP
              which would be demoting the player’s account to help other active
              players reach higher tiers.
